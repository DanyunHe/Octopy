            Modern mobile devices have access to a wealth of data suitable for learning models, which in turn can greatly improve the user experience on the device. For example, language models can improve speech recognition and text entry, and image models can automatically select good photos. However, this rich data is often privacy sensitive, large in quantity, or both, which may preclude logging to the data center and training there using conventional approaches.
            Federated Learning is a decentralized model training approach by leaving the training data distributed on the mobile devices, while learning a shared model by aggregating locally-computed updates.
